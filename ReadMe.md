# Art2See (Art To See)
Work in progress OWOP addon to make
# Contributions
are welcome
<!-- # General idea
User can send image descriptions with coordinates (can make them private) -->
# TBD (to be done)
### general
- account creation
  - captcha
  - 1 account per ip
  - account referer?
  - discord integration?
- open source the server?
- ask for help
### backend
- some protocol so user can communicate/request stuff from server
- database
- discord bot for verifications
- owop archivizer bot (it can be used for thumbnails)
### frontend:
- colors/styles... I can't make things look good so I would be grateful if someone would help with it
  - You can find styles in src/A2NStyles.css 
- connection with the server (part of protocol)
- option to not publicize coordinates
### after it is in a working state
- add addon to https://github.com/LapisHusky/betteropm
